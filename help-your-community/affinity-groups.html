<!--I greatly challenged myself to use my available resources while completing this project. This is the most complicated programming project I have ever completed, and I have learned a ton. This project was a big step outside of what I believed I could do, so I am very proud of myself for accomplishing the challenge. When I first started my code writing, I realized that I didn't remember a lot of the tags and attributes that I needed. I knew that I had taken notes of previous demos, so I split my screen between old coding projects and the midterm coding project, so that I could easily look back to my notes. For the attributes and tags I either didn't understand or that I didn't have written down, I looked on W3 Schools to see if I could locate them. If I was still stuck, I reached out to a peer or teacher. I felt confident in my HTML and CSS skills, though I was very nervous about coding the JavaScript buttons. JavaScript is very unfamiliar to me so I struggled learning how to connect the buttons to their respective functions. After lots of trial and error, I got the buttons working and I even stylized them. I ran into some setbacks with organizing my grid and tables, but I was able to work through them and complete the project. I am very happy and proud of how my webpages turned out. -->
