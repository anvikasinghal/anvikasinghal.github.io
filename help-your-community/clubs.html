<!--CHALLENGES: The most difficult parts of this project code-wise was getting the grid to work and working out the javascript functions (thank you for your help, I had been stumped on that for a while). There were so many divs to keep track of and they all needed their own area in the grid, which took up a huge amount of time and effort. One little mistake ended up messing up the whole thing. Adding onto the code difficulty, working together on this kind of project came with difficulties too. The largest part was just making sure everything looked cohesive, which ended up causing a lot of wasted work if there was a bit of lack of communication. So overall, I think the code itself was a medium difficulty to grasp and it would certainly be possible to push myself further, but the problem was the time constraints in which what I have right now is my limit.-->
