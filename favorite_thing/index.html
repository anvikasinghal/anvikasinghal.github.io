        <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
        <p>There's a few, but we all know reflections aren't on that list :)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>some of my favorites are...</h2>
    <ul class="normal_list">
        <li>the campus</li>
        <li>rowing</li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary><a href="https://www.eastsideprep.org/current-families/ebc-week/" target="_blank">EBC</a>
                </summary>
                <p>also a really cool part of EPS, 10/10 highly recommend</p>
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>the tech and tools</li>
        <li>the people</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="exclamations">but another thing that I find really cool is the <span
            style="font-size: x-large; color: rgb(125, 140, 81);">EV
            Club</span></p>
    <p>sure, the school has a bunch of clubs, but really, EV is the best<br><span id="footnote">*however, if you
            truly aren't convinced, a bunch of others can be found <a
                href="https://www.eastsideprep.org/current-families/clubs-and-academic-teams/"
                target="_blank">here</a></span></p>

    <h2>sooo... what is this EV Club??</h2>
    <p class="exclamations">well let me tell you!</p>
    <p>basically, we have a junk miata that we are turning into a fully electric car.<br> just recently, we finally got
        it running, and are excited to keep working on making it better.</p>

    <h2>i've literally never heard of it. how did you even find out about it?</h2>
    <p>one day, a long long time ago (like a year), one of my friends dragged me into the parking garage without telling
        me where we were going.<br> I had zero idea what I was doing. I mean, look at this thing!</p>

    <img src="images\EV Car.jpg" alt="" width="300">

    <p>looks pretty complicated, huh? anyways, I went back the next week, then twice a week, and eventually, I kind of
        felt like I knew what I was doing!</p>


    <h2>okok whatever, why should I come?</h2>
    <p class="exclamations">I suppose it depends on who you are</p>
