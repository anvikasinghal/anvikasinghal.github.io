    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <p>There's a few, but we all know reflections aren't on that list :)</p>

    <h2>some of my favorites are...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>the campus</li>
        <li>rowing</li>
        <li>EBC</li>
        <li>the tech and tools</li>
        <li>the people</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>but another thing that I find really cool is the EV Club</h2>
    <p>sure, the school has a bunch of clubs, but really, EV is the best</p>
    <p>however, if you truly aren't convinced, a bunch of others can be found <a
