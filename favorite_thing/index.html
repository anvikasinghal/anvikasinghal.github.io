    <h1>My Favorite Thing About School</h1>
    <p>There's a few, but we all know reflections aren't on that list :)</p>

    <h2>some of my favorites are...</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>the campus</li>
        <li>rowing</li>
        <li> <a href="https://www.eastsideprep.org/current-families/ebc-week/" target="_blank">EBC</a> </li>
        <li>the tech and tools</li>
        <li>the people</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>but another thing that I find really cool is the EV Club</h4>
    <p>sure, the school has a bunch of clubs, but really, EV is the best<br>however, if you truly aren't convinced, a
        bunch of others can be found <a href="https://www.eastsideprep.org/current-families/clubs-and-academic-teams/"
            target="_blank">here</a></p>

    <h2>sooo... what is this EV Club??</h2>
    <h3>well let me tell you!</h3>
    <p>basically, we have a junk miata that we are turning into a fully electric car.<br> just recently, we finally got
        it running, and are excited to keep working on making it better.</p>

    <h2>i've literally never heard of it. how did you even find out about it?</h2>
    <p>one day, a long long time ago (like a year), one of my friends dragged me into the parking garage without telling
        me where we were going.<br> I had zero idea what I was doing. I mean, look at this thing!</p>

    <p>looks pretty complicated, huh? anyways, I went back the next week, then twice a week, and eventually, I kind of
        felt like I knew what I was doing!</p>


    <h2>okok whatever, why should I come?</h2>
    <h3>I suppose it depends on who you are</h3>
