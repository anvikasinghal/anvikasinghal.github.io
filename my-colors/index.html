        <h1>MY GENIUS - SKIING</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the Pacific Northwest... first stop, skiing!</p>

        <h2>introduction</h2>
        <p>If you've never heard of skiing, you are obviously missing out. Skiing is the most freeing, slightly
            frightening, exiting thing I have ever experienced. Believe me, I know it can seem intimidating and a little
            scary, but it truly is a matter of just starting and not letting your fear get in the way.</p>

        <p>Maybe you still aren't convinced... and that's fine! But, if you keep reading, I'll teach you the basics
            anyways :)</p>


        <h2>basics</h2>
        <p>In short, when you are skiing, you have boots and you have skis. The easiest way to stop when you are first
            leaning is to just make a wedge shape with your skis. To go faster, you keep them parallel. Finally, to
            start turning, shift your weight to your left ski to turn right and vice versa.</p>

        <h1>About Color Scheme</h1>

            <img style="width: 300px" src="images/color-scheme-inspo.jpg" alt="">

            <h2>type of color scheme</h2>
            <p>triadic, with a few customizations</p>

            <h2>what emotion should it evoke</h2>
            <p>The color scheme is a pretty neutral but not boring combination. I think it brings about a feeling of
                comfort and security by using the combination of neutral colors and muted tones of brigher colors
                (purple, green, blue). It also reminds me a little of nature.</p>
